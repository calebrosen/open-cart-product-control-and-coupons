# open-cart-product-control-and-coupons
Accesses a federated database with multiple opencart stores and gives sales agent a way to log in to a local site that allows them to control product quantity and make their own coupons without admin intervention.
The coupon part is only working with opencart's native coupons. I will not be including the database part for security reasons, and all database connections have been redacted for obvious reasons.
